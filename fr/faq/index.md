### Is Ghost a CMS? <a id="is-ghost-a-cms"></a>
**Ghost is a platform dedicated to one thing: Publishing.** It's beautifully designed, completely customisable and completely Open Source. Ghost allows you to write and publish your own blog, giving you the tools to make it easy and even fun to do. It's simple, elegant, and designed so that you can spend less time messing with making your blog work - and more time blogging.

**Ghost is not a CMS.** We recommend [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) if you are looking for a CMS.

### Why NodeJS? <a id="why-nodejs"></a>
Please see this [blog post](http://blog.ghost.org/hosted-platform-preview/) which explains the decision.

### What is Markdown? <a id="markdown"></a>

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
