                <p>If you're not receiving the newsletter, the first course of action is to check your account settings to ensure your email address is correct and your email preferences are set to subscribed.</p>
                <h4>Check the email on your account</h4>
                <p>If you need to correct a typo in your email address or change the email address associated with your membership, click <b>Edit</b> next to your address when viewing your account settings.</p>
                <p>Once saved, you'll need to confirm the change by clicking the confirmation link, which will arrive via email to your new email address's inbox.</p>
                <h4>Check spam & promotional folders</h4>
                <p>Once the email has been confirmed, the next course of action is to check your spam folder, and any promotional folders, set up by your mail provider.</p>
                <h5>Spam</h5>
                <p>If the newsletter landed in spam, you can mark the email as 'not spam' within your mail client â€” this should ensure that future newsletters arrive in your inbox going forward.</p>
                <h5>Promotional folder</h5>
                <p>If the newsletter arrived in your promotional folder, move the email to your main inbox. This should teach your mail client to place the newsletter in your primary inbox going forward.</p>
                <h5>Add to Contacts</h5>
                <p>To help avoid future emails arriving in spam or promotional folders, you can also add the newsletter 'From' email address to your contact list.</p>
                <h4>Check with your mail provider</h4>
                <p>For those with corporate-based email addresses, you may need to reach out to your help desk or IT department to troubleshoot any potential reasons that may prevent you from receiving email newsletters.</p>
