# Members.js

[![CI Status](https://github.com/TryGhost/members.js/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/TryGhost/members.js/actions)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40tryghost%2Fmembers-js.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40tryghost%2Fmembers-js)

Drop-in script to make the bulk of members work on any theme.

## Usage

Add below script in your theme's `default.hbs` just before the end of body tag OR in the code injection footer in Ghost Admin.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@tryghost/members-js@latest/umd/members.min.js"></script>
```

### Custom trigger button

By default, the script adds a default floating trigger button on the bottom right of your page which is used to trigger the popup on screen.

Its possible to override the default trigger button with your own by adding data attribute `data-members-trigger-button` to any HTML tag on page, which will hide the default trigger and allow controlling the popup state by clicking on this element.

The script also adds custom class names to this element for open and close state of popup - `gh-members-popup-open` and `gh-members-popup-close`, allowing devs to update its UI based on popup state.

## Basic Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git@github.com:TryGhost/members.js.git
```

2. Change into the new directory and install the dependencies:

```shell
cd members.js
yarn
```

#### In this repo(Members.js):

- Run `yarn build` to create the minified bundle with your changes at `umd/members.min.js`

#### In your theme(Ex. Lyra):

- Copy `members.min.js` from above and paste it in your theme at `assets/built/members.min.js`
- Add below code in your theme's `default.hbs` just before end of body tag

```
