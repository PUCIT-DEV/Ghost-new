# Uploadcare/Ghost Integration

Forked: https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost

This is **temporary repository** for integrating Uploadcare with
Ghost bloggin platform.

## Getting Started

* Clone the GitHub repository;
* Install Grunt and build assets:
  1. `npm install -g grunt-cli`
  1. `npm install`
  1. `grunt init` (and `grunt prod` if you want to run Ghost in production mode)
  1. `npm start`
* Navigate to `http://localhost:2368/ghost/` and sign up
* Go to post editing

## Goal

See `ghost-uploadcare.js`. This is a draft, and needs to be converted to a proper Bower package.
