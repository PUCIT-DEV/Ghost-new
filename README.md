![Ghost is a simple, powerful publishing platform that allows you to share your stories with the world.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/6626501/b2bb072c-c8ff-11e4-8e1a-2e78e68fd5c3.png)

The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Install Node.js

# Hosting a live Ghost site

<a href="https://ghost.org/pricing"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/18662071/f30da886-7f18-11e6-90f2-42c0ade79fd1.png" alt="Ghost(Pro)" /></a>

The easiest way to deploy Ghost is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. You can have a fresh instance up and running in a couple of clicks with a worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

Not only will it save you [many hours per month](https://ghost.org/ghost-pro-vs-self-hosting/), but all revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation, which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost itself. So youâ€™ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service **at the same time**! Talk about win/win. :trophy:

[Other options](https://docs.ghost.org/v0.11.9/docs/getting-started-guide) are also available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself, of course. The freedom of choice is in your hands.


# Theme Developers

If you are developing a Ghost theme for your own site or creating themes for others to use we recommend installing Ghost on your own local machine. Luckily we have a brand new Ghost CLI to make this really easy ðŸ˜„

You can talk to other Ghost users and developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome).
