The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Deploying Ghost

<a href="https://ghost.org/pricing"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/18662071/f30da886-7f18-11e6-90f2-42c0ade79fd1.png" alt="Ghost(Pro)" /></a>

The easiest way to deploy Ghost is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. You can have a fresh instance up and running in a couple of clicks with a worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

Not only will it save you [many hours per month](https://ghost.org/ghost-pro-vs-self-hosting/), but all revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation, which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service **at the same time**! Talk about win/win. :trophy: 

[Other options](http://support.ghost.org/deploying-ghost/) are also available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself, of course. The freedom of choice is in your hands.

&nbsp;


# Staying Up to Date

When a new version of Ghost comes out, you'll want to look over these [upgrade instructions](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) for what to do next.

You can talk to other Ghost users and developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome). We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm UK time.

New releases are announced on the [dev blog](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/). You can subscribe by email or follow [@TryGhost_Dev](https://twitter.com/tryghost_dev) on Twitter, if you prefer your updates bite-sized and facetious. :saxophone::turtle:
