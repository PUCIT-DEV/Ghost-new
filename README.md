![Ghost is a simple, powerful publishing platform that allows you to share your stories with the world.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/6626501/b2bb072c-c8ff-11e4-8e1a-2e78e68fd5c3.png)

The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.
