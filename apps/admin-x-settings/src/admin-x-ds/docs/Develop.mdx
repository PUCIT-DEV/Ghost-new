# Development

<p className='excerpt'>A guideline on how to create new components or change existing ones.</p>

## Structure

The design system contains **reusable components**. These components live in one of the following groups:

### Global
Contains common components that are used across all parts (in all apps) of the admin: buttons, checkboxes, lists, input fields etc—the usual suspects. You can check them in the "Global" group in the sidebar.

### App specific
The Admin is broken down to multiple React apps, each with its own set custom of reusable components. **These components are also part of the design system** which allows potential reusability in the future, and forces designers and developers to think in terms of the design system.

### What about non-reusable components?

With all fairness, **most of the components should be part of the design system**. Of course there pages, containers etc. in each app which are obviously **non-reusable**, however these should be built up of _mostly_ reusable components.

<p className='sb-highlight'>If you can't decide whether a component is reusable or not, then default to adding it to the design system!</p>

## How to develop new components?

If there's a single thing you should remember is this:

<p className='sb-highlight'>Storybook is **the central tool** of the design system, it is **not** an afterthought. It is the **starting point** of the development of any new component.</p>

### Steps to develop new components
[TBD: expand]

1. Create the react component in the desgn system with a rudimentary interface
2. Create a new story (you can use `Boilerplate.stories.tsx` to get started)
3. Develop the details of the new react component
4. Create stories for all interesting use cases. There should be a story for the most common parameter combinations.
5. Test the new component in your app. If something is off, think about how you can solve it in the system—avoid visual hacking in the app.
