# Style Guide

<p className='excerpt'>Paper-like editorial, magazine style for the UI: bold typography, minimalistic design with large spaces.</p>

Ghost Admin borrows stylistic elements from editorial, magazine design. Itâ€™s minimalist, organised, uses grids, columns and whitespace extensively. It avoids bubbles and islands, has high contrast both in color and size. It is consciously moving away from the ubiquotus Tailwind UI style to stand out and remain timeless.
