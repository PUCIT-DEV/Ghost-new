    <p>Just a year ago we launched our **Ghost(Pro)** hosted platform to allow people to easily deploy and run Ghost blogs.</p>

    <p>We’ve come a long way.</p>

    <p>From the very beginning, during the [Kickstarter Campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform), we put forward the idea of a hosted platform for an Open Source project as a means to make it both sustainable and profitable.</p>

    <p>At that point it was really just a theory and a dream. No Open Source project had ever done anything quite like it before.</p>

    <p>**Today, the Ghost Foundation turns over $350,000 and, even more significantly: is profitable.**</p>

    <p>2014 was a pretty incredible year. It’s surreal to look back at just how far we’ve come. 2015 is set to be even bigger, and we’ve got a lot of plans.</p>

    <p>## A Bigger Focus on Transparency</p>

    <p>For the last year we’ve realised that a lot of things we’re passionate about are symptoms of something larger. Ghost is Open Source because we believe in free and open software which is available to everyone to use, hack and redistribute as they see fit. Ghost is not-for-profit because we believe in building an incredible company which is dedicated to its users, rather than creating wealth for its founders.</p>

    <p>We’ve realised the larger umbrella that embodies all of these elements that ties them all together is quite simple: Transparency.</p>

    <p>What we’re really excited about is building a company with integrity that’s completely open about what it does and why.</p>

    <p>This year we’re going to place a much bigger focus on being even more aggressive about the number of things which we open up to the public. We’ve learned a lot from our friends over at [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com) and we’re going to be taking a leaf out of their book in several ways.</p>
