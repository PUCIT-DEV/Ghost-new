Project Plans:
    - Depending upon the syllabus covered in class we will have weekly tasks assigned in between us.
    - When our work got completed we need to raise a pull request to merge these changes to teamsparkuno repository.
    - We will have a formal discussion on the pull requests and everyone needs to defend their works.
    - If we all agree upon the discussion we will merge the change to teamsparkuno repository.
    - We will meet two times in a week to discuss about the work flow and help each other if we have any doubts.
    - Everyone will have all access permissions.
