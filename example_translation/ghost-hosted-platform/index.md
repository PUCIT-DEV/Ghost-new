## Where do I go with a Ghost hosted platform problem / query? <a id="support"></a>

If your issue or query is not answered here, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:support@ghost.org">support@ghost.org</a> and we'll give you a hand!

## How do I install a Theme? <a id="install-theme"></a>

You can install (or create) any theme you like for Ghost. It's 100% open for whatever you want to do with it. You can either download an existing theme from <http://marketplace.ghost.org> - or build your own. Once you've got a theme you'd like to use - simply click on the "edit" button of your blog on <https://ghost.org/blogs/> and upload the theme .zip here. It will be immediately activated on your blog! You can do this as many times as you like :)

## Is there FTP support? <a id="ftp-support"></a>
We don't provide direct access to your blog via FTP, but we've built the infrastructure in a way that you should always be able to get to everything you need without requiring it.

Unfortunately older software has perpetuated the idea that you should edit files live on your serverâ€¦ this is actually a pretty terrible idea! Your production server should always be for your ready-to-go, completed files.

While you're working on a theme, the best thing to do is run a copy of Ghost locally on your computer (this is very easy, and there are lots of tutorials about how to do it, see our <a href="{{ site.url }}/{{page.lang}}/installation">installation docs</a>). Once your theme is ready, you can make a zip, upload the file - and you're done! No disruption to your live site or visitors, and you always have a backup on your computer.

## How do I setup a custom domain? <a id="domains"></a>

There are instructions how to setup your custom domain at <https://ghost.org/blogs/domains/>.

Unfortunately, we can't give you *exact* instructions on how to setup your domain because every domain registrar is different. If you get stuck, a quick email to their support address should have your setup in no time :) - remember to forward on the instructions in the above link.
