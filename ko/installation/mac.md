# Installing on Mac <a id="install-mac"></a>

To install Node.js and Ghost on your mac you'll need an open terminal window. You can get one by opening spotlight and typing "Terminal".

### Install Node

*   On [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) press install, a '.pkg' file will be downloaded
*   Click on the download to open the installer, this is going to install both node and npm.
*   Click through the installer, finally entering your password and clicking 'install software'.
*   Once the installer is complete, go into your open Terminal window and type `echo $PATH` to check that '/usr/local/bin/' is in your path.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If '/usr/local/bin' does not appear in your $PATH, see the <a href="{% if page.lang %}/{{ page.lang }}{% endif %}/installation/troubleshooting#export-path">troubleshooting tips</a> to find out how to add it</p>
